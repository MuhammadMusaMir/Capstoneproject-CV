    <p>That was just a joke probably a bad one. Well thankyou for looking at my almost very first webpage i made by the grace of my brilliant teacher Dr. Angela Yu. Yes you heard the right name as you are looking at my profile and you are possibly related to developer community wether as a customer or as a talent hunter you definately come across this name. I hope to learn as much as i can so that i can build brilliant pages and as i mentioned my teacher i believe i am in good hands and i will definatley become a good full stack developer one day then i will show this page to Dr Angela Yu to let her know this is how i started ...</p>
